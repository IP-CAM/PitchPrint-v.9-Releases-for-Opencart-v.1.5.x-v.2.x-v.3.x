# PitchPrint for OpenCart

This PichPrint plugin for OpenCart provides an interface between PitchPrint and OpenCart.
It retrieves all your designs from your PitchPrint account for you to select and assign to a product. When opening the product on the frontend, it will have the selected design ready for customization.
You can link your PitchPrint account to OpenCart, by providing your domain API key and Secret Key in the PitchPrint Plugin for OpenCart's settings page.

The plugin allows you to do the following on OpenCart:

* Assign a PitchPrint design to a product
* Choose the display mode of PitchPrint on a per product basis. ( Fullscreen, Inline, Mini )
* Indicate whether it is compulsory for a product to be customized, before add to cart is possible.
